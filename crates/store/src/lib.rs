//! `local-rag` durable storage layer.
//!
//! This crate owns the SQLite databases described in spec 03: the canonical
//! `state.sqlite` (source of truth) and, later, the rebuildable `cache.sqlite`.
//!
//! T01-02 introduces the **state open policy** and the **bounded writer**:
//!
//! - every connection to `state.sqlite` applies the normative pragmas
//!   (`journal_mode=WAL`, `foreign_keys=ON`, `synchronous=FULL`,
//!   `busy_timeout=5000`; spec 03 §2);
//! - all writes flow through a single bounded async queue feeding one writer
//!   task, so SQLite's single physical writer is respected and producers see
//!   backpressure (spec 02 §5 L4a, 03 §3);
//! - no writable [`rusqlite::Connection`] ever leaves this crate — the only way
//!   to mutate `state.sqlite` is [`StateWriter::transaction`]. Reads use a
//!   read-only connection ([`StateDb::open_read`]) that cannot write.
//!
//! Migrations/DDL (T01-03/04) and `cache.sqlite` (T01-05) build on top of this.
//!
//! `rusqlite` is re-exported so downstream crates share one SQLite vocabulary
//! (`local_rag_store::rusqlite`).
